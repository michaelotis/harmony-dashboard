Harmony Explorer
=======

What is the Harmony ONE Explorer?
--------------

[Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) is a fast and secure blockchain for decentralized applications.
Our production mainnet supports 4 shards of 1000 nodes, producing blocks in 5 seconds with finality.

[The Explorer](http://54.187.20.215:8080/#/) allows users from all backgrounds to view and explorer the Harmony Blockchain by
making visible the latest blocks, pending transactions, top validators, and much more!
