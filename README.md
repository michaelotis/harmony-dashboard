What is the Harmony ONE Explorer?
--------------

[Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) is a fast and secure blockchain for decentralized applications.
Our production mainnet supports 4 shards of 1000 nodes, producing blocks in 5 seconds with finality.

[The Explorer](http://54.212.182.221:8080/#/) allows users from all backgrounds to view and explorer the Harmony Blockchain.
Making visible latest blocks, pending transactions, top validators, and much more!
